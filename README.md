# 4-1-Multiplexer-In-Tanner
There are multiple ways to design a 4:1 Multiplexer.This specific design was constructed using NAND and NOt gates instead of the traditional method which consists of AND and OR gates.

The 4:1 Multiplexer consists of 4 input lines A,B,C,D and two selection lines S0,S1 and 1 output line.
Given below is the schematic of the 4:1 Multiplexer.
